Here's the one where I based this game. https://github.com/danielfesalbon/checkers . The first one was kinda lame, it's not yet finish but this one was. I guess haha. Leave a star or fork. Thanks.

## Notes
 - Consider player discretions on turns to move
 - No undo yet, so please be careful especially on capturing enemy knights. Mistaken move may lead to restart the game. Sorry haha
